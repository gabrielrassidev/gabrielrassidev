# 👋 Hi, I'm Gabriel Rassi

# From strategy to code — building full stack, from the ground up.

I'm Gabriel Rassi — a digital strategist turning into a full stack developer.  
After 4+ years building marketing systems and launching digital products,  
I'm now focused on writing code, designing logic, and shipping real software.

This is my journey — built in public, one commit at a time.
